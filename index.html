    <p>
      This webpage displays two types of visualizations: a grouped bar chart and a scatter plot. Both visuals use distinct data sets
      to analyze a correlation between their respective independent variables.

    <h2>Simple formatting instructions</h2>

    <p>
      Use <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags to enclose a paragraph in html. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code> to enclose a heading. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to force a line break.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two premade <code>div</code> in this document that will hold your visualizations. The first one has id <code>vis1</code>, the second one has <code>vis2</code>. Write your explanation and analysis close to each of your visualizations.

      This is our first visualization, a scatter plot.
      The dataset's elements were selected from a random set of data points we encountered online. The dataset examines whether there 
      exists a correleation between the number of plants and fish in a certain pond. Since the number of fish and plants seem pretty 
      uncorrelated on the surface and the objective is to discover whether there exists some correlation, we felt that a scatterplot would 
      best serve our purpose. A scatter plot plots two independent attributes against each other, which is exactly what we need to do in order to
      spot a potential correlation. <br>

    <!-- Visualization goes here -->
    <div class='vis-holder' id='vis2'></div>

    <p>
      This is our second visualization, a grouped bar chart. The dataset describes restaurants in Boston through features like a rating and their
      distance from Northeastern's campus. We chose to use this dataset because the data is original and relevant to ourselves. A grouped bar chart is an appropriate encoding because it
      groups data by each restaurant, and is able to use sub-groups, individual bars, to represent the two features. The two features are
      also differentiated by color; red bars show the rating and blue bars show their distance. <br>
